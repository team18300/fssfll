Get ready for an exciting journey into the world of Python programming for your LEGO EV3 robot! In this series of beginner-friendly training modules, you'll learn how to make your robot move and tackle various missions. Don't worry if you don't have a physical robot yet – we've got you covered with a virtual robot and a simulator that mimics the real EV3 experience.

For this level, we'll be using "Pybricks Micropython" to program a virtual "EV3 Robot" using a "Simulator".  Let's review what each of these terms means.

# Pybricks Micropython
MicroPython is like a language that helps you talk to your real or virtual LEGO EV3 robot. You can use it to give your robot cool instructions, like telling it to move around or do tricks. It’s like using a special language to talk to your robot so you can tell it what you want it to do. So, with MicroPython, you get to be the boss and make your robot do all kinds of fun stuff!

More technically, the Micropython language is a software implementation of the Python programming language that is designed to run on microcontrollers and small embedded systems. It brings the ease and simplicity of Python to hardware platforms with limited resources, making it well-suited for devices like microcontrollers, single-board computers, and other small computing devices.  Pybricks is a programming library specifically designed for use with LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3, a robotics platform created by LEGO for educational purposes. Pybricks allows users to program the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 brick, motors, sensors, and other components using the Python programming language.

# EV3 Robot
The EV3 robot is something you specially design to solve exciting challenges. Picture it with wheels, sensors, and all sorts of cool features—ready to tackle the missions and tasks in the competition arena.

The EV3 robot can be equipped with sensors that act as its eyes and ears, helping it navigate the competition field and interact with the elements around it.   But here's where it gets even more awesome: you get to be the commander! Using a special computer called the "brick," (or sometimes called the "brain") you'll give your robot precise instructions to complete specific missions all by itself. It's like coaching a robot teammate to score points, solve problems, and showcase the special abilities you have given it in the competition.

# Simulator
A Simulator is virtual world for your EV3 robot! It is a special computer program that lets you test and practice your robot's moves without needing the actual physical robot.  It helps you learn and experiment with programming—creating the special instructions that tell your robot what to do.  It's like having a practice field for your robot where you can make mistakes, learn, and perfect your coding skills.

Before you jump into the more advanced training, make sure to complete each of the introductory modules.  These modules are designed to introduce Pybricks Micropython using a virtual EV3 robot in a simulator. They'll lay the foundation for your coding skills and prepare you for the challenges that lie ahead in the intermediate level training. Happy coding!
